    <!-- This is all the HTML code I wrote. This was a very fun experience. It took me a while to start getting anything to happen, but once I built momentum, it all came very quickly. I used the freecodecamp website to render what I was writing, so I unfortunatly have no idea if any of this will actually render, but it looked pretty good on the website.-->
